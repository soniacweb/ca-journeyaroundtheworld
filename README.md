# Journey Around the World

Part of the the codecademy frontend path.

## Objective

In this project, you will use the knowledge you gained on color theory and apply it to a simple web page. You will take an existing grayscale website, select a color scheme, and apply the colors to various elements and sections within the design.

This means you will need to consider how to select your color scheme, adhere to proper contrast of elements, and carefully apply those colors to the page to create an elegant design.

Remember, it’s important to use the color wheel tool to determine your color scheme and properly pair colors together. When applying colors to the page, make sure you select a dominant color with additional supporting colors that provide structure to the design.

When changing the colors within your code, you can use either hexadecimal, RGB, or HSL values.

You can view an example here we’ve created which uses a monochromatic color scheme.
